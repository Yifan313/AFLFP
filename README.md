# AFLFP
A Database with Annotated Facial Landmarks for Facial Palsy

## Introduction

<p align = "justify"> 
Facial landmark detection is a crucial step for the task of computer-aided facial palsy diagnosis, which enables to focus on the affected facial regions for learning asymmetry, shape, and texture features of facial palsy. However, it is still very challenging to accurately detect salient landmarks on facial palsy images due to the unavailability of sufficient training databases providing annotated facial landmark images of facial palsy. To this end, we present a database in this article named annotated facial landmarks for facial palsy (AFLFP). AFLFP is a diverse, and reliable database that contains facial images with 16-class facial expressions of asymmetric facial expressions from 88 subjects. Each facial image is independently and manually annotated with 68 facial landmarks.
